I have a lot of names. The name Art Singer I use in England is an abbreviated name. Art Green was the predecessor of Art Singer, but I somehow didn't feel that name... In Latvia I'm known more as Dons, which I chose myself. That nickname came in and dragged me along and I get along with it well".[15] While in Los Angeles, he received four offers to be the lead singer in various rock bands.In 2007, he performed in Zigmars Liepiņš' popular musical theatre Adata with the song "Ja Tu Man Esi" ("lit. 'If I Have You'").[16] The song was nominated for Top Radio Hit at the Latvian Music Recording Awards that year.[17]</p>

Of course, it's not pleasant when you see that you've been put in last place. You have nothing to lose! Maybe that helped a little.
